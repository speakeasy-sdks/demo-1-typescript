# ActiveResourceResponse

Active Resources represent the concrete resources provisioned for an Environment. They are provisioned on the first deployment after a dependency on a particular resource type is introduced into an Environment. In general, Active Resources are only deleted when their introductory Environment is deleted.

Active Resources are provisioned based on a Resource Definition. The Resource Definition describes how to provision a concrete resource based on a Resource Type and metadata about the Environment (for example the Environment Type or the Application ID). The criteria for how to choose a Resource Definition is known as a Matching Criteria. If the Matching Criteria changes or the Resource Definition is deleted, the concrete resource represented by an Active Resource might be deleted and reprovisioned when a deployment occurs in the Environment.
