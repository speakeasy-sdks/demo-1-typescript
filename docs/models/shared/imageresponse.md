# ImageResponse

DEPRECATED: This type exists for historical compatibility and should not be used. Please use the [Artefact API](https://api-docs.humanitec.com/#tag/Artefact) instead.

Container Images (known simply as Images) can be registered with Humanitec. Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines can then notify Humanitec when a new build of a Container Image becomes available. Humanitec tracks the Image along with metadata about how it was built.
