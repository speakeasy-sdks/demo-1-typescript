# SetResponse

A Deployment Set (or just "Set") defines all of the non-Environment specific configuration for Modules and External Resources. Each of these Modules or External Resources has a unique name.

Deployment Sets are immutable and their ID is a cryptographic hash of their content. This means that a Deployment Set can be globally identified based on its ID. It also means that referencing a Deployment Set by ID will always return the same Deployment Set.

Deployment Sets cannot be created directly, instead they are created by applying a Deployment Delta to an existing Deployment Set.

**Basic Structure**

```
 {
   "id": <ID of the Deployment Set>,
   "modules" : {
     <ID of Module> : {
       "profile": <Defines how the optional "spec" property is interpreted>
       "spec": {
         <Properties that depend on the "profile" property.>
       }
       "externals": {
         <External Resource Name> : {
           "type": <Resource Type>,
           "params": {
             <Properties which parametrize the resource depending on the Resource Type.>
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
```
