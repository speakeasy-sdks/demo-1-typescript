/**
 * Workload Profiles provide the baseline configuration for Workloads in Applications in Humanitec. Developers can configure various features of a workload profile to suit their needs. Examples of features might be `schedules` used in Kubernetes CronJobs or `ingress` which might be used to expose Pods controlled by a Kubernetes Deployment.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Workloads in Humanitec are implemented as Helm Charts which must implement a specific schema.
